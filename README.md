# JetBrains Academy. Project: Tic-Tac-Toe
 
## Description
Tic-tac-toe is a game played by two players on a 3x3 field.
- One of the players plays as 'X', and the other player is 'O'. 'X' plays first, then the 'O' side plays, and so on.
- The players write 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 field.
- The first player that writes 3 'X' or 3 'O' in a straight line (including diagonals) wins.

Suppose the bottom left cell has the coordinates (1, 1) and the top right cell has the coordinates (3, 3) like in this table:

|(1, 3)|(2, 3)|(3, 3)|
|------|------|------|
|(1, 2)|(2, 2)|(3, 2)|
|(1, 1)|(2, 1)|(3, 1)|
